Sebber's Project PlaySchool
===========================

This is my way of learning more about [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/ "Scala") and [Play Framework 2.x](http://www.playframework.org/ "Play Framework").

Many thanks to people like [ornicar](https://github.com/ornicar) who share their projects openly for others to learn more from. In his case, specifically his fantastic browserbased chess game [lichess.org](http://lichess.org/) where he shares his [play2.1-based project here](https://github.com/ornicar/lila "lichess.org github-repository")
